<h1>Hello, world! From faizan</h1>
<h2>SIR SYED UNIVERSITY</h2>

<p>Welcome to my new single-page application, built with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>ASP.NET Core and C# for cross-platform server-side code</li>
    <li>Angular and TypeScript for client-side code</li>
    <li>Webpack for building and bundling client-side resources</li>
    <li>Bootstrap for layout and styling</li>
</ul>
<p>.NET CORE 1.1 also set up:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Client-side navigation</strong>. For example, click <em>Counter</em> then <em>Back</em> to return here.</li>
    <li><strong>Server-side prerendering</strong>. For faster initial loading and improved SEO, your Angular app is prerendered on the server. The resulting HTML is then transferred to the browser where a client-side copy of the app takes over.</li>
    <li><strong>Webpack dev middleware</strong>. In development mode, there's no need to run the <code>webpack</code> build tool. Your client-side resources are dynamically built on demand. Updates are available as soon as you modify any file.</li>
    <li><strong>Hot module replacement</strong>. In development mode, you don't even need to reload the page after making most changes. Within seconds of saving changes to files, your Angular app will be rebuilt and a new instance injected is into the page.</li>
    <li><strong>Efficient production builds</strong>. In production mode, development-time features are disabled, and the <code>webpack</code> build tool produces minified static CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
</ul>
